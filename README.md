This project is a quiz application made in Android studio. It uses XML at the front end and Kotlin at the back end. The app tests the general knowledge skills of a user. Users can log in to the application and attempt questions selected by the application. Ten random questions are displayed one by one to the user. Each question has four options, out of which only one is correct. The user can select one and submit it. The application checks the option chosen by the user to see if it is the correct one. And if it is correct, then the user is awarded some points. In case the user selects the wrong option or skips any question penalty will not be applied. The display is one way. After attempting all the questions, the user can view the total score. The user also gets feedback from the system according to the performance.
